sic - simple irc client
=======================
sic is an extremly fast, small and simple irc client.  It reads commands from
standard input and prints all server output to standard output. It multiplexes
also all channel traffic into one output, that you don't have to switch
different channel buffers, that's actually a feature.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. sic is installed into
/usr/local by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sic 
(if necessary as root):

    $ make clean install


Running sic
-----------
Simply invoke the 'sic' command with the required arguments.


[OPTIONAL] Using sic with tmux to redirect system messages to a dedicated pane, as well a dedicated pane for showing messages that mention your username
------------------------------
Start a tmux session and 3 panes.
In the 1st tmux pane, type the following command after replacing USER/PASS with your user (note, USER appears twice in below command):
    sic -n USER -k PASS 2> /run/shm/ircSystemMessages.txt | tee >(grep -i --line-buffered USER > /run/shm/usernameMentions.txt)
In the 2nd tmux pane, type:
    tail -f /run/shm/ircSystemMessages.txt
In the 3rd tmux pane, type:
    tail -f /run/shm/usernameMentions.txt

Note: you can replace /run/shm/ircSystemMessages.txt with /dev/null if you don't want to receive any system messages.
It may be a good idea to periodically truncate those two extra files by simply doing "echo > /run/shm/ircSystemMessages.txt".
